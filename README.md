This is Android application called 'One Motive' developed for local NGO which helped in connecting donors to NGO and NGO to the people in need more efficiently.

Donors can donate food, cloths, books, etc. They could also provide feedback and keep themselves updated with the NGO’s activities. 

Also developed another app for management of NGO’s resources. NGO members could accept the donations and contact donors. Also, they could notify other members about any events like cleanliness-drives.
